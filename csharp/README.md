# Optimizely C# (C-Sharp) Style Guide

## Sources

Heavily based and adapted from the style guides of:
- [Microsoft](https://github.com/dotnet/docs/blob/main/docs/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions.md)
- [Google](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/csharp-style.md) 

## Reasons

Coding conventions:

- Create a consistent look to the code, so readers can focus on content, not the layout.
- Enable readers to understand the code more quickly by reducing the cognitive load during interpretation.
- Facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.
- Demonstrate best practices *over time* (this guide is intended to evolve).
- Educate readers on new lanugage features as they're incorporated into code.
- Help establish shared, automated linter rules.
