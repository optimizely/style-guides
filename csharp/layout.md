# Layout Conventions

Good layout uses formatting to emphasize the structure of your code and to make the code easier to read. Microsoft examples and samples conform to the following conventions:

- Use the default Code Editor settings (smart indenting, four-character indents, tabs saved as spaces).
- Write only one statement per line.
- Write only one declaration per line.
- If continuation lines are not indented automatically, indent them one tab stop (four spaces).
- Add at least one blank line between method definitions and property definitions.
- Use parentheses to make clauses in an expression apparent, as shown in the following code.
